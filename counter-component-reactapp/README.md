Welcome to my simple React Counter App! This project was created to demonstrate fundamental concepts of React, including state management, asynchronous state updates, and understanding state as a snapshot through a user-friendly interface.

The app features a Counter component that displays a count and includes four buttons: "Increment", "Increment After Delay", "Increment Twice", and "Correct Increment Twice". Each button showcases different aspects of state management in React:

Increment: Increases the count by 1 immediately.
Increment After Delay: Adds 1 to the count after a 2-second delay, showing asynchronous state updates.
Increment Twice: Attempts to increment the count by 2 immediately, illustrating React's batching of state updates.
Correct Increment Twice: Correctly increments the count by 2 by using a state updater function, ensuring that the app correctly handles sequential state updates.
This project served as a hands-on opportunity to explore React's useState hook and the behavior of state updates in response to user interactions. Feel free to explore the code and interact with the Counter to see these concepts in action!
